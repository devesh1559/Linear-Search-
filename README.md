# Linear-Search
## AIM
To perform  linear search in an array 

## Theory
Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm which is sometimes known as sequential search. In this algorithm each element of array is compared with the targeted element sequentially. Time required to search an element using linear search algorithm depends on size of the list. In the best case it is present at the beginning of the list and in the worst case element is present at the end. The time complexity of linear search is O(n).

## Algorithm
void search(int a[MAX],int x)
	int i;
	for(i=0;i<MAX;i++)
		if(a[i]==x)
	element found
      return
   else   
	Element not found
  
  ## Conclusion 
  The linear search works for both sorted and unsorted array
